# TODO

1. Make this be a monorepo so that the relationship between package and example app is higher fidelity (e.g. a package needs to be in node_modules for lots of tooling to work as expected...)

2. Switch to conditional require of react-query in main package.

3. Maybe switch to create react app. It's a way more standard build system.

4. Rename the package and the exports. I don't like them.
